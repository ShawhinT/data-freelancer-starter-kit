# Getting Your First Client

## Ancedotes
*How did you get your first client?*

### Shaw Talebi
It took me 9 months to get my 1st client. Not because it was challenging, but becuase of procrastination.

I made my Upwork profile in Dec 2021, but didn't actively apply to jobs (i.e. 2 per week) until Aug 2021. Once I did this, it took me 3 weeks to land my first client. It was a small EEG clinic looking for some guidance on using machine learning in their practice, which overlapped with my grad school research. 

I ended up having a couple of calls with them and creating a write-up on the basics of supervised learning and decision trees. While it was a simple gig, going through the whole process gave me a ton of confidence and set me up for a future (more lucrative) project on Upwork.

### Rex Elardo
I got my first client almost completely by luck. Essentially, I was just applying to jobs on Upwork.

At the time, I had 0 stars and 0 client reviews, so I charged this lady $25/hr for a job that honestly was worth $60+ an hour. She was happy and gave me 5 stars!

But she was a small client–I needed a bigger one to stay relevant
 
The Upwork search engine recommended I apply for this one web scraping job. I didn't really do web scraping, but I gave it a shot. I charged $30/hr to scrape over 10,000 pages, and made around $3000 with that contract. He also gave me 5 stars!

Since then, I have been increasing my rates slowly, until now, when I charge 97.76 per hour. I get fewer clients, and the ones who want a discount I give them, provided they hire me for 10 hours minimum (I will go as low as 65/hr)

But yes, getting the first client was definitely a lot of luck mixed with paying for those connections and writing a sincere cover letter (not some AI answer–some clients read right through that)
