## What do I sell?

## Who do I sell to?


Notes from meeting:
- Ask yourself: What have I done before?
- Picking a AI/data sub-domain (e.g. ML, LLMs, agents, data infra, data dashboard)
    * Setting all emotional approaches aside, there are two main ways you can make progress. I don't prefer one over another, it's just two different ways of doing business. They are:
        1) Pick a field in the industry which the companies need to maintain their systems and business. For example, companies will always need to maintain their data infra, making data engineering a solid field. Likewise, the companies will always want a comprehensive understanding of their data, making dashboarding & BI visualization another solid field. 
        2) Pick a "hype" topic. A field in which the excitement overwhelms the practical gains and tradition, where nothing is predictable until it has started. For example, you can find many businesses willing to work on AI workflows even though they aren't sure how and why they need to have an AI system to solve their problems. This is not necessarily bad. AI can have many (or no) benefits for a company. You can only tell by accepting to carry out an thorough analysis of the business. It should go without saying that making use of the hype does not mean that you should "convince" the business to use AI for everything. It would be wrong to sell them something they do not need. Reliabilty is the best form of long-term marketing. Don't forget that.  

- Portfolio
    * There are several portfolios which you can build and utilize:
        
        1) A landing page with a list of your previous clients included.
        2) A showcase of the demos of the projects you have built for your clients. This can be included in a web page or a platform like Github. 
        3) A platform (like a blog, YouTube channel etc.) where you share authentic details about your work. This basically ensures people that you know what you are talking about. 

- How do I sell? (wrapping paper, how you pitch, client communication)
