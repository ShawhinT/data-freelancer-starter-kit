# Getting Your First Client

*How did you get your first client?*

### Shaw Talebi
It took me 9 months to get my 1st client. Not because it was challenging, but becuase of procrastination.

I made my Upwork profile in Dec 2021, but didn't actively apply to jobs (i.e. 2 per week) until Aug 2021. Once I did this, it took me 3 weeks to land my first client. It was a small EEG clinic looking for some guidance on using machine learning in their practice, which overlapped with my grad school research. 

I ended up having a couple of calls with them and creating a write-up on the basics of supervised learning and decision trees. While it was a simple gig, going through the whole process gave me a ton of confidence and set me up for a future (more lucrative) project on Upwork.
